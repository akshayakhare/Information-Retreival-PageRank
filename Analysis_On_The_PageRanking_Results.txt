The top 10 pages in the page ranking are as mentioned below:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Experimental Home Page for Lemur Search
The Economist: Copyright Notice
Security Assurance Requirements
Web Development Team
Evening News
List of company names
Important information and Disclaimer
General Disclaimer
List of deveoper names
Milton's homepage

Based on the above information its clear that these turn out to be high ranked pages. 
It is obvious that most of the pages will have their links pointed to pages such as
Home page, copyright pages, Disclaimers and List of company names.
Although there are some pages which doesnt look that important, as Milton's homepage,
but maybe it is important for this site, as many important pages might have an outlink
to the Milton's homepage.
There are some pages which may not be as important for the user while searching, like
WebDevelopment Team, List of developer names, Copyright Notice. But then again, these 
pages will have numerous links to their page, which make them high ranked.
Pages like Security Assurance Requirements, Evening News and Important information 
& Disclaimer may be pretty useful for the user to look into. It may contain what the 
user was actually looking for.

The top 10 pages with highest inlinks 
-------------------------------------
Experimental Home Page for Lemur Search
Environmental News-State
DRCNet Online Library of Drug Policy 
Sports Gate HomePage
The Economist: Copyright Notice
Skeptics Society Message Board
WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
Some List of trademarks
General Disclaimer
A site for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community

For the top 10 inlinks, we have the same highest page rank as the highest page with inlinks.
This makes sense that pages with highest inlinks may have the highest page rank, but then 
again, a page can be referenced by thousands of unimportant links it will not make it a high
ranked page. 
In this case its a coincidence that both the highest page rank is the highest page with inlinks
as well. This is not neessary to be the same case always.

"It has to be referenced by important links to make it a high ranked page."

For pages like "Environmental News State" & "DRCNet Online Library of Drug Policy" have a high
count of inlinks, but they might have been referenced by relatively low ranked pages as 
compared to "The Economist: Copyright Notice" & "General Disclaimer" which have relatively low
inlinks but they have been linked by relatively high ranked pages.

If a user will try to search for Lemur webpages, its highly probable that he will get the 
homepage as its first result, and the other mentioned high ranked pages in their list of 
results.
But its obvious that the user would not be interested in page results like 
"Copyright Notice" and "List of Developer's name".
These pages might be of no interest to the user as they might not be looking for these details.

So for conclusion, the page rank does depend on the number of inlinks, and recursively
their page ranks. This obviously does not mean that the user will be happy with the highest 
ranked page, but refining on this list is much easier than using a list of pages which 
were ranked without this algorithm.
